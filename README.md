üöÄ Speech-to-Text & Summarization API
Transform any audio or video file into a detailed transcript and an intelligent summary with a single API call. This project provides a powerful and easy-to-use solution for automating the processing and understanding of audio content.

üé• Demonstration

‚ú® Key Features
Multi-format Conversion: Supports popular file formats like .mp3, .mp4, and .wav.

High Accuracy: Utilizes the WhisperX model for superior transcription accuracy.

Intelligent Summarization: Employs the T5-small model from Hugging Face to generate concise, coherent summaries that retain the core message of the content.

Long-form Content Handling: Automatically chunks the input text to process long audio files, bypassing model input length limitations.

RESTful Interface: The API is built on FastAPI, ensuring high performance and easy integration into any application.

Hardware Optimization: Automatically leverages an available GPU (CUDA) to accelerate processing.

üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Technology Stack
The system is built on a combination of leading AI models and libraries:

Component	Technology	Role
Backend Framework	FastAPI	For building a high-performance, asynchronous API.
Web Server	Uvicorn	ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
Speech-to-Text	WhisperX (Model: small)	An enhanced version of OpenAI's Whisper for improved speed and accuracy.
Text Summarization	Hugging Face Transformers (Model: t5-small)	A powerful Transformer model for text summarization tasks.
Audio Processing	Pydub	Processes and converts various audio formats into the standard WAV format (16kHz, mono).

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
File Ingestion: The client sends an audio file (.mp3, .mp4, .wav) to the /transcribe endpoint via a POST request.

Audio Normalization: Pydub converts the input audio file into a standardized .wav format (16kHz, 1-channel mono) to ensure compatibility with the Whisper model.

Transcription: WhisperX loads the normalized .wav file and performs the speech-to-text conversion.

Text Chunking: Because summarization models have input length limits, the full transcript is divided into smaller "chunks".

Summarization: Each text chunk is fed into the t5-small model to generate a summary for that specific chunk.

Result Aggregation: The individual summaries are then combined to form the final, complete summary.

JSON Response: The API returns a JSON object containing the full transcript (transcript) and the final summary (summary).

üì¶ Installation Guide
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Python dependencies:
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content and run the pip install command:

Ini, TOML

# requirements.txt
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
torch
pydub
transformers
sentencepiece
openai-whisper
whisperx
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Install ffmpeg:
Pydub requires ffmpeg to process various audio/video formats.

On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

On macOS (using Homebrew): brew install ffmpeg

On Windows: Download a build from the ffmpeg official site and add it to your system's PATH.

(Optional) Install PyTorch with CUDA Support:
To leverage your GPU, follow the instructions on the official PyTorch website to install a version compatible with your CUDA driver.

üöÄ Usage
Run the API server:

Bash

uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
Send an API request:
Use a tool like curl or Postman to send an audio file to the /transcribe endpoint.

Example with curl:

Bash

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/transcribe" \
     -F "file=@/path/to/your/audio.mp3" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
API Response:
You will receive a JSON response similar to the following:

JSON

{
  "transcript": "Welcome to the speech-to-text and summarization API. This system is capable of processing various types of audio files and provides accurate results...",
  "summary": "This API converts speech to text from multiple file formats, using AI models to deliver accurate results."
}
